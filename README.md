# AlphaFoodies
AlphaFoodies was my final year university project. I was responsible for designing and building the chef dashboard.
AlphaFoodies is a food ordering system where customers don't need to stand in a line or wait for a service attendant to order food. 
I implement the chef both the frontend and the backend.
